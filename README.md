## Features
* **Dynamic Simulation:** Real-time 3D object simulation within a geospatial coordinate system.
* **Modular Architecture**: Model dynamic objects using a composition-based entity-component system (ECS) with a configurable property framework.
* **Photoreal Rendering**: Visualize photorealistic environments, including terrain, ocean, urban infrastructure, and atmospheric conditions.
* **Extensible Framework**: Add custom functionality through C++ and Python-based plugins. 
* **Scenario Viewer App**: Interactive 3D application for visualizing scenarios.
